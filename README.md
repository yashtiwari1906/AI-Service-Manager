### :star2: About
- IRYWAT is a platform which is ready to deploy server where you don't have to care much about how you manager traffic and request flow you just need to focus on building you AI microservice and this will provide a communication layer to that AI service
- This is container based so host your models somehere in this world and bring it's IP and perform the business or any other cool logics with IRYWAT

###  :movie_camera: Demo
- here is a recorded video of the APIs from postman.
- one is detector API where we pass an image for registration and other one was the verifier where we send an image for verification.

###  :outbox_tray: Set up
- These are the steps required to install the project.
- I have built this project on Ubuntu OS but I've not tried installing it in other OS but in that case you can go forward with docker installation.

_E.g_

## DataBase setup
    - This is a critical step as whole project is based upon this DB installation 
    - `docker network create -d bridge network1`
    - `docker pull ankane/pgvector`
    - `docker run --name pgvector-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test@123 -p 5432:5432 --network network1 ankane/pgvector`

    Here your DB image is pulled and you container will be up and running with username postgres and password test@123 Now you need to configure it.

    - go to shell_scripts/db_setup/ and start this bash script configure_db.sh by 
    - `chmod +x ./configure_db.sh`
    - `./configure_db.sh` 

    Congratulations!!! your DB is ready you also connect this DB with pgAdmin to run custom queries.

## Docker installation 
    - Now just be in this directory and type one magic command to turn the server on 
    - `docker-compose up`

    that's it Now you can hit the detector and verifier APIs and take the feel of this powerfull system
 
## Local installation
1. Get a API Key at [website](example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install npm@latest -g
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'YOUR API KEY HERE';
   ```

### :thinking: FAQ
with respect to API there are just two one for detection and storing the identity and another for verification  **toggle lists.** 

<details>
  <summary>Quick Questions</summary>
  
  ### FAQs
  1. DB setup is necessary right now for the project to work
  2. Docker-compose.yml is enough to make this project up and running 
     * But you need to make a docker network because database will be running as a container
     * We'll try in future to remove this dependancy

  <!-- ### Here's the MARKDOWN template to build your own toggle lists
  ```
