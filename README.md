###  :movie_camera: Demo
- here is a recorded video of the APIs from postman.
- one is detector API where we pass an image for registration and other one was the verifier where we send an image for verification.

###  :outbox_tray: Set up
- These are the steps required to install the project.
- I have built this project on Ubuntu OS but I've not tried installing it in other OS but in that case you can go forward with docker installation.

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Python >= 3.8

## DataBase setup
- This is a critical step as whole project is based upon this DB installation 
    - `docker network create -d bridge network1`
    - `docker pull ankane/pgvector`
    - `docker run --name pgvector-db --rm -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test@123 -p 5432:5432 --network network1 ankane/pgvector`

- Here your DB image is pulled and your container will be up and running with username postgres and password test@123 Now you need to configure it.
- go to shell_scripts/db_setup/ and start this bash script configure_db.sh by 
    - `chmod +x ./configure_db.sh`
    - `./configure_db.sh` 

- Congratulations!!! your DB is ready, you can also connect this DB with pgAdmin to run custom queries.

## Docker installation 
- Now just be in this directory(root) and type one magic command to turn the server on 
    - `docker-compose up`

- In case want to run this application only(not detector & verifier) through docker container then firstly expose your port 5432 to internet using ngrok on which your postgres vectorDB is running then make image of this from dockerfile and then run the container with following commands
    - `docker build -t <name-for-image(foreg: service_manager)> .`
    - `docker run -p 5050:5050 --rm --name <name-for-container> -e NGROK_PORT=<ngrok-port> <name-of-image(foreg: service_manager)>`

- that's it Now you can hit the detector and verifier APIs and take the feel of this powerfull system
 
## Local installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yashtiwari1906/AI-Service-Manager.git
   ```
2. ```sh
    cd AI-Service-Manager
    ```
2. Install dependancies
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. go to prequisites/detector_verifier_servers/ in another terminal and hit following command to switch on the servers for detector and verifier
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```
4. Now your detector is up at (127.0.0.1:5001/predict) & verifier is up at (127.0.0.1:4001/predict) for predictions you can use https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-5jFNU1p6IkZnRuUXuf0hpqCTLyRIe8L/view?usp=sharing  dummy payload to check them individually

5. Now get back to the main terminal and export an environment variable ENV
    ```sh
    export ENV=local
    ```
6. Now hit the main server by 
    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
7. Now you can try this by hitting registration folder for registration of face and verification folder for verification of the face under the ai_service_manager folder in the postman collection attached in this repo

### Request & Reponses
    - you can find postman collection at https://drive.google.com/file/d/15sDPYq4CAaT1pdMViJRhbQXqHPOOjOwV/view?usp=sharing where the request and response are documented
    - but as per general information:
    - if running system from local ip for this server will be 127.0.0.1:8000 otherwise 0.0.0.0:5050 
    two APIs are exposed in this system right now 
        - Registration: 
            - {ip}/api/chehra/register-face/
            - where you need to provide an image file in the request along with name of the face which you want to register
        - Verification:
            - {ip}/api/chehra/verify-face/
            - here you only need to provide an image

### :rocket: Deployment
- you can go in the deployment folder to find the deployment file for the kubernetes deployment of the project.
- Install minikube first and then just deploy every deployment file in it by:
    `kubectl apply -f <file_name.yaml>`
- Then type `minikube ip` this will be your IP and `31111` will be your port which is the nodeport for service-manager-service
- so url in cluster based environment will be `http://<minikube_ip>:31111`
- One thing to remember when your'e estabilishihng the communication between multiple pods try to make sure your'e calling with port not with targetPort or containerPort
- In GKE cluster you've to deploy these `NodePort` as `LoadBalancer` so that you'll have an external IP and you'll call it through `port` not targetPort or NodePort

<!-- ###  :file_folder: File Structure

- Adding a file structure can help users gain a high-level understanding of your project. 
- If your project has too many files, you can consider showcasing only the main folder paths.

### :thinking: FAQ
with respect to API there are just two one for detection and storing the identity and another for verification  **toggle lists.** 

<details>
  <summary>Quick Questions</summary>
  
  ### FAQs
  1. DB setup is necessary right now for the project to work
  2. Docker-compose.yml is enough to make this project up and running 
     * But you need to make a docker network because database will be running as a container
     * We'll try in future to remove this dependancy

  <!-- ### Here's the MARKDOWN template to build your own toggle lists
  ```
